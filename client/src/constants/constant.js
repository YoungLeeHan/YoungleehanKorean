Her explanations and materials are incredibly helpful and she is always willing to answer questions. She makes lessons fun and engaging and I look forward to every class.

Not only do you get to learn how to express yourself in Korean but you get to learn about the culture. I highly recommend this teacher!!

I have seen great improvement in my kids korean skills. For adult private lessons, she is always well prepared with new materials and teaches the material in a dynamic and fun fashion. As a native speaker, Younghyun can explain in detail the grammar and provides real life examples in korean culture for the grammar and language being taught in video clips and music. I have been told that my Korean skills have improved greatly since starting my private lessons with Younghyun by others, and feel more comfortable speaking in public. I would highly recommend anyone considering learning korean to take lessons with Younghyun.",

She is well organized and always prepared. She makes lessons fun, engaging, and individualizes the content. My children have had a lot of speaking and listening practice, as well as learning hangul. I have seen them practice and initiate conversation in Korean since having her as a tutor. I highly recommend her for anyone looking for a Korean tutor.",

    msg: "My daughter started Korean language classes with Mrs. Lee twice a week from the age of 3. Over the past two years, my daughter's Korean speaking, writing, and reading skills have expanded considerably. Each class is structured with a set curriculum, so each lesson builds on the previous one and the kids can learn systematically. Each of the previous lessons are continually reinforced in the next. While the class has a set framework, Mrs. Lee is excellent at pivoting, engaging the kids with songs and activities that enhance the lesson, or just using the kids' conversations and curiosities to teach new vocabulary or grammar. It is amazing what she fits into 30 minutes! As an aside, as a Korean-American mom, with less than fluent Korean language skills, this class has also helped ME learn new things that I can then incorporate into everyday speaking and teaching with my daughter. Mrs. Lee is an excellent educator with a gift for working with children. I highly recommend her to any mom looking to teach their children Korean!",
